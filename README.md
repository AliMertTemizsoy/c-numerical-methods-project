# Numerical Methods in C

## üìå Description
This project was created for the **Numerical Analysis** course using C language. It allows the user to input a mathematical expression (as a string), manually parses it and then apply one of several numerical methods to compute the result.

Implemented methods:
- Newton-Raphson Method
- Bisection Method
- Regula Falsi Method
- Gaussian Elimination
- Inverse Matrix Calculation
- Simpson‚Äôs Rule
- Trapezoidal Rule
- Numerical Differentiation

## üß† Technologies
- C
- Math.h
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Manual string parsing

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Compile & Run

```bash
gcc numericalMethods.c -o numerical_methods -lm
./numerical_methods
